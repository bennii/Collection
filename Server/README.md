# Server

This is a very old server that I wrote as part of a private project. It was supposed handle gamelobbies and automated matchmaking for a mobile game. The development started on Windows, hence only windows was tested. Before uploading the server to github I adjusted the source code so that it would compile on Linux using the latest GNU compiler. As of now,  the adjustments for Linux are not the best, but they work. There are better ways with less lines of code to achieve the same result. I will correct it one day.

The comments in the source are German because I am German. I might translate them. Until then there is Google Translate I guess.

I do not remember how thoroughly the features of the server were tested and as of now I have no idea why there is a hashmanager or why I am using hashes. I do not remember and I did not look into that part of the source that much while adjusting it for Linux. Maybe you can tell me.

The Makefile only compiles on Linux. You can use this source code to learn or maybe implement it into your project. Have fun!
