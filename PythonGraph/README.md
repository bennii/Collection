# PyhtonGraph

The python script that you can see here was a bit of an experiment. During an university assignment I was given the data that you can see in data.csv. Our task was to write a set of functions that analyze a graph based on the provided data. I went one step further and tried to visualize the graph. To do so, not much is required, except for a library that you can install. The graph is not optimized in terms of visibilty quite yet. Additional parameters and configuration is required.

I am uncertain of the license because I was given the data. Hence there is no license on this particular data set and python script. You may review the data and python script in this repository but the use is prohibited for now. That includes snippets from said documents.
